### 1. Create image registry
k3d comes with a handy CLI tool to create and manage locally running cluster. In order to share your docker images with this cluster you'll need a image registry. To create this registry run the following command.
```bash
k3d registry create kw-r --port 4500
```

Commands to create cluster
```
k3d cluster create kw --servers 1 --agents 1 --port 9080:80@loadbalancer --registry-use kw-r:5000 --registry-config registries.yaml
```

Is cluster running?
```
kubectl get nodes
```

Build your project
```bash 
docker build -t localhost:<port-of-project>/project:v0.1 $PATH_TO_PROJECT
```

Push the project
```bash
docker push localhost:<port>/project:v0.1
```

## Deployment
Deploy images to the kubernetes cluster with the following command
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment-file.yml
```

## Check deployment status
Command to check if deployment was succesful
```bash
kubectl get deployment
```

## Port forward pods
Usage of the `kubectl port-forward` command.
```bash
kubectl port-forward [NAME-OF-POD] <Port>
```

## Exposing project
This can be done by deploying a kubernetes service for the project.
Which can be done by the following command;
```bash
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

## Deploy kubernetes ingress
The last step is to deploy ingress. This tells kubernetes how to traffic from externally is routed to each and every service.
```bash
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
```

# Current deployment in k8s
Currently the project has the gateway 'deployed' in the k8s stack. To get this up to standards, I need to add the ingress and service to access them
from my windows/linux machine.
- Frontend deployed
- gateway deployed


# Changes to a project
Changing the project will affect the deployment when the tag is changed, the tag is placed behind the container. For this project I stuck to v0.x.x, current stage: v0.1.x

# Database deployment
Kubernetes is also able to host a database which can be used to create a cluster that is able to be fully functional. The database can be set to have limited capacity.
The database will need multiple pods:
- Deployment
- PersistentVolume
- PersistentVolumeChain
- Service

In this process we start off by launching the Persistent volume, followed bu the persistent volume chain and the deployment. The last step is to launch the service, once this is done we can check if everything is up and running by running
```
kubectl get pods
```
If all of this information returns correctly, we succesfully launched a database instance into kubernetes.

# Troubleshooting
Is the container not running? Run the following command:
```
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pods <NAME>
```
OR
```
kubectl logs <POD_NAME>
```
This returns logs of the application within pods or the reason the pod has crashed,
F.e. pod is unable to pull image OR pod is stuck in a crashloop
